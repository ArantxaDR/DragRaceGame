### Description

A project to show what I've ñearn during GenK course:

    • Use docker to build an image
    • Use Webcomponent and Lit to build the project
    • Create a reusable Webcomponent and publish it in npm
    • Use jest to test the code
    • Use Cypress to test end-to-end experience
    • Use git and GitLab

To make this project I have:

    • Design the appearance of the project and organization of content in sections
    • Development of the JS code within Lit for the functionalities required in the portfolio
    • Run test to ensure code operation
    • Layout of the web

### Improvements

The next steps to make a better proyect:

    • Increase dificulty level
    • Add a timer to show how much time to finish the game
    • Add a flip counter to show how many clicks the user makes
    • Add a Game Over display ans restart the game
    • Add new games, maybe a personality test
