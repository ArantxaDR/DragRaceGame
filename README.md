### Description

A project to show what I've ñearn during GenK course:

    • Use docker to build an image 🐋
    • Use Webcomponent and Lit to build the project
    • Create a reusable Webcomponent and publish it in npm
    • Use jest to test the code ✅
    • Use Cypress to test end-to-end experience
    • Use git and GitLab 🦊

To make this project I have:

    • Design the appearance of the project and organization of content in sections 🖌️
    • Development of the JS code within Lit for the functionalities required
    • Run test to ensure code operation ✅
    • Layout of the web
    • Use Docker to build an image of the web 🐋

### Improvements

The next steps to make a better proyect:

    • Increase dificulty level 🔝
    • Add a timer to show how much time to finish the game ⏰
    • Add a flip counter to show how many clicks the user makes
    • Add a Game Over display ans restart the game 🎮
    • Add new games, maybe a personality test
